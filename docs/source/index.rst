AAU Volunteer Management System documentation
===============================================

Welcome to the documentation for our implementation of the Volunteer Management
System ("the VMS"). These docs are geared toward admins and fellow
developers. They provide details on the inner workings of our application, how to configure,
and how to run it.

Get started with an :ref:`overview` of the code base then jump over to :ref:`quick_start` to spin a development container
to see the app in action. You can run through the :ref:`tutorial` to familiarize yourself with the general flow
of editing and updating the code.
